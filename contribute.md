### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª **Pull Request (PR) procedure**

**PR Steps**:-

1. **Make changes** and **commit it** to a feature branch.

    - **Feature branch** => name: `add-TopicName`.
        - Example: `add-Template1`
    - **Issue Branch** => name: `issue-issueName` Or `issue-issueID`. ( like for bug fixes or other issues)
        - Example: `issue-formatting-styling`

2. Make a **PR** from your `add/issue` branch to `development` branch.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:- _Feature and issue branches are temporary branches, so after the merge (successful PR) the feature branch will be deleted._
